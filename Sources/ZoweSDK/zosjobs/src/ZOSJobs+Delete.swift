    /// Launches request to cancel a job and purge its output with the following HTTP method and URI path: DELETE /zosmf/restjobs/jobs/<jobname>/<jobid>
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - jobName: The name of the job to be canceled and purged.
    ///   - jobId: The job Id on JES to be canceled and purged.
    ///   - onCompletion: Closure with a JSON response from z/OS system with either the result of the operation (for an asynchronous request) or the job feedback document containing details about the job that was canceled (for a synchronous request).
    ///   - response: The JSON response from z/OS system with the result of the operation or an error description.
    /// - Note: The response depends on whether the request is processed synchronously or asynchronously, as follows:
    ///   1. For an asynchronous request, the response message is expected to come with HTTP 202 status code description. To determine whether the request was successful, the caller can use getJobStatus(jobName: String, jobId: String) { response in } method.
    ///   2. For a synchronous request, to determine the success of the operation, the caller has to check the "status" property in the JSON job feedback document for a value of 0 (zero). The response message with HTTP 4nn or HTTP 5nn status code description indicates that an error occurred.
