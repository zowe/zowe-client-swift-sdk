    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - datasetName: The name of a z/OS data set to create. The length of the data set name cannot exceed 44 characters.
    ///   - datasetType: The data set type describing the necessary kind of data set to be created

    ///   - onCompletion: Closure with a JSON response from z/OS system with the result of the operation. If an error occurs, the response message contains its description.
